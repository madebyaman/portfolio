I think, handling errors is one of the most important skill in programming. This is because errors can occur anywhere in your code and if you donâ€™t handle those errors carefully your users might face an issue.

Javascript being a dynamically typed language makes our work slightly difficult for programmers like us.

Letâ€™s see various ways to handle errors in Javascript.

## Throwing Exceptions

When a piece of code runs into a problem, you raise (*or throw)* what is known as an **exception.** Throwing an exception immediately jumps out of the current flow of a program and returns the exception.

Letâ€™s consider an example of a Cake ðŸŽ‚  shop.

```jsx
const inventory = {
 ButterCake: 5,
 CarrotCake: 4,
 SpongeCake: 7,
}

const cart = [];

const addCakeToCart = (cakeName) => {
 if (!inventory.hasOwnProperty(cakeName)) {
  throw new Error(`No such cake: ${cakeName}`);
 }
 if (inventory[cakeName] <= 0) {
  throw new Error(`Sorry no ${cakeName} cakes left`)
 }
 cart.push(cakeName)
 inventory[cakeName] -= 1;
}
```

The `throw` keyword is for throwing exceptions. While `Error()` is a constructor function to create new error.

To catch an exception, you can use `try...catch` block.

```jsx
try {
 addCakeToCart(cakeName)
} catch(e) {
 console.log('Something went wrong', e)
}
```

And the best part about exceptions?

The functions in between the points where the error occurred and where it is handled, can completely forget about error.

## Selecting Catching

Can you figure out whatâ€™s wrong with this `try...catch` block?

```jsx
try {
 addCakeToCart(cakeName)
} catch(e) {
 showError('Invalid cake')
}
```

The problem is that the `catch` block is completely ignoring the error `e`. Even if error is, say, network failure, the code will still say `Invalid cake`.

So in general, you want to catch specific kinds of exception.

How do we do this?

We can defined a new type of error like this:

```jsx
class CakeInputError extends Error {}
```

Then use it:

```jsx
const addCakeToCart = (cakeName) => {
 if (!inventory.hasOwnProperty(cakeName)) {
  throw new CakeInputError(`No such cake: ${cakeName}`);
 }
 if (inventory[cakeName] <= 0) {
  throw new CakeInputError(`Sorry no ${cakeName} cakes left`)
 }
 cart.push(cakeName)
 inventory[cakeName] -= 1;
}
```

Here `CakeInputError` is not defining anything new. The only objective of this error class is so we can recognize errors by using `instanceof`. Using our new error class, we can selectively catch errors.

```jsx
try {
 addCakeToCart(cakeName)
} catch(e) {
 if (e instanceof CakeInputError) showError('Invalid cake')
 else throw e;
}
```

This will catch instances of `CakeInputError` and let unrelated exceptions through.

## Assertions

Assertions are simply checks inside a program to verify is something is working the way it is supposed to.

They are simply used to find programmer mistakes.

For example:

```jsx
const addCakeToCart = (cakeName) => {
 if (!cakeName) throw new Error("No cake name provided"); // ASSERTION
 if (!inventory.hasOwnProperty(cakeName)) {
  throw new CakeInputError(`No such cake: ${cakeName}`);
 }
 if (inventory[cakeName] <= 0) {
  throw new CakeInputError(`Sorry no ${cakeName} cakes left`)
 }
 cart.push(cakeName)
 inventory[cakeName] -= 1;
}
```

Now if you call `addCakeToCart` without providing a cakeName, it will blowup.

However, I wouldnâ€™t recommend using assertions. Writing tests and using type checkers like Typescript is better than using assertions.

## Cleaning up exceptions

Cleaning up exceptions is very important, especially if you are program has several side effects.

Letâ€™s go back to our example of cake shop:

```jsx
const inventory = {
 ButterCake: 5,
 CarrotCake: 4,
 SpongeCake: 7,
}

const cart = [];

const addCakeToCart = (cakeName) => {
 if (!inventory.hasOwnProperty(cakeName)) {
  throw new Error(`No such cake: ${cakeName}`);
 }
 if (inventory[cakeName] <= 0) {
  throw new Error(`Sorry no ${cakeName} cakes left`)
 }
 cart.push(cakeName)
 inventory[cakeName] -= 1;
}

const checkout = (userId) => {
 try {
  confirmPayment(userId)
 } catch(e) {
  console.log('error', e)
 }
}
```

Did you spot the problem?

Our `addCakeToCart` removes a cake from the inventory even before checking out. It never takes following scenarios into the account:

- A shopper never proceeds with the checkout
- Shopperâ€™s payment fails

How do we solve this problem?

One way to address this is to use fewer side effects. Instead of removing items from the inventory by a function, why not compute values with the changed data.

The second way is to use `finally` block to reset everything.

For example:

```jsx
const addCakeToCart = (cakeName) => {
 if (!inventory.hasOwnProperty(cakeName)) {
  throw new Error(`No such cake: ${cakeName}`);
 }
 if (inventory[cakeName] <= 0) {
  throw new Error(`Sorry no ${cakeName} cakes left`)
 }
 cart.push(cakeName)

}

const checkout = () => {
 let paymentSuccessful = false;
 try {
  confirmPayment()
  paymentSuccessful = true;
 } catch(e) {
  paymentSuccessful = false;
  console.log('error', e)
 } finally {
  if (paymentSuccessful) removeItemsFromInventory()
 }
}
```

This version removes items from inventory, only if payment is successful.

## Conclusion

Error handling is quite a difficult topic to pick at first. I am always learning about various ways to handle errors without blowing up the program.
